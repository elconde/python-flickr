# Flickr Python Interface
This is an interface to the Flickr API written in Python. There are a
few out there, but I wrote this from scratch as a learning exercise.

I've tested this in Linux. It shouldn't be too hard to port to Windows.
If you're willing to test drop me a line.

## Prerequisites
Python 3. I've included all the third party libraries needed so you
don't have to install them.

## Version
0.0.0
